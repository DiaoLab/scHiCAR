**The following scripts use Astrocytes as an example to demonstrate how we performed downstream analysis using pseudo-bulk FASTQ files in our scHiCAR paper. These scripts are adapted from the nf-core/hicar pipeline (https://github.com/jianhong/hicar/tree/dev2rc), with some modifications. For instance, while the original nf-core pipeline only uses R2 reads from long-range (>10kb) read pairs for open chromatin peaks calling, here, we use all R2 reads for peak calling\.**
